/**
 * Price to pay:
 *
 * 1. contextBridge strips prototype methods.
 * It only clones an object's own enumerable properties.
 *
 * Therefore, each API should define its public methods as an arrow-function class field,
 * so they survive the bridge.
 *
 * 2. Not leaking the injected dependency.
 * A normal private ipc (or constructor-param property) compiles to an own enumerable field,
 * which contextBridge would then clone onto window.api.counter.ipc.
 * I used a hard-private #ipc field, which is invisible to property enumeration,
 * so the dependency stays truly internal.
